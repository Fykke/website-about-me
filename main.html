                <div class="content_text">
                    <br>My favorite project is my game called "Dodge".<br>
                    I wrote the first version of it around February 10, 2021.<br>
                    Finally completed the project on March 7th.

                    <br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px;">About the game process: </span><br><br>
                    The point of the game is that the player playing as the square needs to dodge the balls flying to the left from the right frame.
                    The square is controlled by pressind WASD keys. 
                    <br>Every 5 points, the balls slightly increase their speed, which complicates the dodging process. <br><br>

                    Player can't escape the playing field:<br> 
                    <ul class="content_ul">
                        <li>If player passes the frame from above, he will be moved down in the opposite direction</li>
                        <li>The same happens if the player goes up</li>
                        <li>Going to the left, the player crashes into the frame</li>
                    </ul>

                    <br><br><span style="font-size: 24px;">Other: </span><br><br>
                    The main menu has settings and a leaderboard.<br>
                    In the settings, player can customize the sound, interface and audio.<br>
                    In the "Theme" section player can change game interface colors. There are 4 options.<br>
                    In the "Audio" section player can change the volume. Is scaled from 1 to 10.<br>
                    The "Skin" section, as the name suggests, gives the opportunity to change the player's skin.<br><br>
                    Applying all settings does not require restarting the game.

                    <br><br>After the game is openned, it randomly decides what skin will be used. It won't be changed after death.
                    <br>The skin of the ball will change randomly after every lose. (two of the ball's skin are my friend's face &#128520. Other skins
                    are the ones that I made in Photoshop using my imagination or redrawn by me items from Minecraft)

                    <br><br><span style="font-weight: 600;">After player collides with the ball: </span><br><br>
                    The game will show:<br>Time alive (seconds), score (how many times the ball reached left frame), and a few options: <br>
                    <ul class="content_ul">
                        <li>Play again</li>
                        <li>To the menu</li>
                        <li>Save score (requires to type player's name)</li>
                    </ul> 

                    <br><br><span style="font-size: 24px;">Leaderboard:</span><br><br>
                    Actually, it is not correct to name it "scoreboard", because it is "leaderboard". Only after i had done this part of the page
                    I noticed this mistake in the game. And it's kind of late to make any changes. I can, but don't want to.<br>
                    So, about the leaderboard. It reads the json file and simply prints all the data from the file. And sorts it by value i.e.
                    collected points (descending).

                    <br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px;">What have been used: </span><br><br>
                    I used my favourite language <span class=span_modules>Python.</span><br>All the logic in my game is made on this language.<br>
                    All the visual part of the game as well as the sounds are made on <span class=span_modules>pygame.</span><br>
                    Also to work with data I imported <span class=span_modules>json</span>, <span class=span_modules>os</span> 
                    and <span class=span_modules>sys.</span><br>
                    To provide random ball position to fly from, I used <span class=span_modules>randint</span> and <span class=span_modules>choice</span> from
                     module <span class=span_modules>random.</span><br>
                    To create an exe file have been used <span class=span_modules>pyinstaller.</span><br>
                    I used a lot of  loops, functions and also used try/except constructions to work with files.<br><br>Also I created an anti AFK system:<br>
                    If a player decides to stay on one place to get a lot of points, after approximately 3 seconds the game will throw a ball right at him and he will lose.<br><br>

                    <br>My second (order not based on project creation date), more useful project, is a program that helps my mom with her work.<br>
                    The latest version of the project was created around June 28, 2021.<br>
                    Writing, if I'm not mistaken, took a couple of days, although the program is quite easy, 
                    since I had absolutely no idea how to work with Excel using code.
                    <br><br>With this project I really helped my mother a lot.<br>
                    Now, instead of losing a few days on reading nad comparing numbers, my program is doing it in a seconds.<br>

                    <br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px;">What has to be done: </span><br><br>
                    Mom has tons of data at work. Sales column and purchases column (contain the exact price of the item). 
                    She has to compare these two columns, and the ideal result is a complete match of both columns. 
                    But this never happens, because someone constantly makes mistakes in filling out, or data on any 
                    purchases and sales simply do not come due to various reasons.
                    <br><br>After comparing the tables (usually contains about 750 sales and 750 purchases), always 5 to 20
                    inequalities are revealed. Then she needs to figure out what these inequalities are, and why they appeared.
                    
                    <br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px;">What my program is doing: </span><br><br>
                    First of all, it is a console program and after opening an exe file, it will print to the console an example of
                    what the user should write in.<br>
                    User has to enter the name of the <span class=span_modules>.xmls</span> file that exists in the same directory
                    as the program exe file. If it doesn't exist, the program will stop working and will be closed.<br><br>
                    Also, in the excel file all the data should be written in the first 2 columns (A and B), if it is not, program
                    will not work correctly.

                    <br><br><span style="font-weight: 600;">If file exists and everything is fine: </span><br><br>
                    The program will: <br>
                    <ul class="content_ul">
                        <li>Print "Updated", in the next line elapsed time since the start of the program and will close itself</li>
                        <li>Then it will update an existing Excel file</li>
                        <li>In the D column it will print all the data that exist in the A column, but did not find a pair (the same number) in the B column</li>
                        <li>In the E column it will print all the data that exist in the B column, but did not find a pair in the A column</li>
                    </ul> 
                    
                    <br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px;">What have been used: </span><br><br>
                    This time i also worked with <span class=span_modules>Python.</span><br>
                    To create an exe file have been used <span class=span_modules>pyinstaller.</span><br>
                    To open and rewrite an Excel file I used <span class=span_modules>openpyxl</span> module and imported
                    <span class=span_modules>os</span> to see computer's files.
                    Also, I wanted it to have at least some kind of beauty, I imported <span class=span_modules>time</span>, to
                    print elapsed time in the console as well as <span class=span_modules>Font, Color, Border, colors, Side</span> from
                    <span class=span_modules>openpyxl</span>.<br>
                    And of course the data comparing. It is done with the help <span class=span_modules>Counter</span> imported from
                    <span class=span_modules>Collections.</span>
                    <br><br>In these type of programs is better to use a C languages, because they are much faster.<br> But in that moment
                    i knew only Python and also it's not an actual product so there is no need to make it as fast as possible.

                    <br>Third project is an authorization/registration program with a profile.<br>
                    The project is finished approximately in 29th of January, 2021.<br><br>
                    The goal was to learn how to work with data.<br><br>
                    I didn't really know what database is and I thought it is something really difficult, that is why at
                    first i saved all the data like logins and passwords in a simple txt document. After I've decided to add
                    an additional options to users (for example, to save their age, country, to change name) I understoot that it is 
                    impossible to store all the data in the simple txt document. <br>
                    Then I put my eyes on <span class=span_modules>Json.</span><br>
                    There storing all the data is very much possible!
                    <br><br>
                    Also I had no clue that something like <span class=span_modules>Regex</span> even exists, that's why
                    to control all the inputs from user, i wrote something like:<br><br>
                    <span class=span_modules>If password length is less than 10, print an error</span><br>
                    <br>Now I see, that it could have been done so much easier, just using <span class=span_modules>MySQL</span> and <span class=span_modules>Regex.</span>
                    <br>But this program was interesting to do without all these features :D

                    After logging in, user can change his data:

                    And of course user can also log out and create a new account, log in to another or close the program.

                    <br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px;">About code: </span><br><br>
                    Program is created with the help of <span class=span_modules>Python.</span><br>
                    The interface is done with the <span class=span_modules>Tkinter</span> package.<br>
                    To work with computer files (.txt at first, then .json) imported <span class=span_modules>os.</span><br>
                    Also imported <span class=span_modules>countries</span> from <span class=span_modules>iso3166</span>
                    (just a list of all the countries), to let user select his country in the profile.<br>
                    If user will try to delete <span class=span_modules>data.json</span>, program will see it in
                    <span class=span_modules>try/except</span> construction and will create new clear <span class=span_modules>data.json</span>.

                    In fact, there is not much to say about it. A simple, well-known game 
                    "Rock paper scissors". <br>There are four buttons in the game:

                        <li>Choose paper</li>
                        <li>Start a new game</li>
                    </ul> <br>

                    After the player chooses a rock, paper or scissors, the computer also randomly makes 
                    its choice. And according to the usual laws of this game <span class=span_modules>(rock beats scissors, scissors 
                    beat paper, paper beats rock)</span>, the code chooses the winner and gives him one point. 
                    <br>Whoever gets 5 points first wins.
                    <br>To play again user can press the reload button and points will be reset to zero.

                    This program is written on <span class=span_modules>Python</span> and the interface
                    is done using <span class=span_modules>Tkinter.</span>
                    To let the computer select rock, paper or scissors, I used <span class=span_modules>random.</span>

                    Since this is my first program and I didn’t have any special knowledge, it was very difficult to make it.<br>
                    The main issues were with understanding how to work with <span class=span_modules>Tkinter</span>, because 
                    I knew absolutely nothing about it.

                    <br><br>As usual, you can download the game and play, but I don't really
                    suggest it, because it's not very interesting to play against bot :)<span style="color: black;"> &#x21B4;</span>

                    <br>The fifth project is a simple calculator. I made it about the same time as the game "Rocks paper scissors",
                    namely on December 16, to practice working with <span class=span_modules>Tkinter</span>, because I was interested in this topic.

                    <br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px;">About code: </span><br><br>
                    As usual, I used <span class=span_modules>Python</span> because I didn't know any other language at the time.
                    The program is really easy, there is nothing special about it and it wasn't hard to write it. I use 5 different 
                    functions, to make some actions with numbers (functions plus, minus, divide etc.)
