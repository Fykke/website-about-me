                    <br>My favorite project is my game called "Dodge".<br>
                    I wrote the first version of it around February 10, 2021.<br>
                    Finally completed the project on March 7th.

                    <br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px;">About the game process: </span><br><br>
                    The point of the game is that the player playing as the square needs to dodge the balls flying to the left from the right frame.
                    The square is controlled by pressind WASD keys. 
                    <br>Every 5 points, the balls slightly increase their speed, which complicates the dodging process. <br><br>

                    Player can't escape the playing field:<br> 
                    <ul class="content_ul">
                        <li>If player passes the frame from above, he will be moved down in the opposite direction</li>
                        <li>The same happens if the player goes up</li>
                        <li>Going to the left, the player crashes into the frame</li>
                    </ul>

                    <br><br><span style="font-size: 24px;">Other: </span><br><br>
                    The main menu has settings and a leaderboard.<br>
                    In the settings, player can customize the sound, interface and audio.<br>
                    In the "Theme" section player can change game interface colors. There are 4 options.<br>
                    In the "Audio" section player can change the volume. Is scaled from 1 to 10.<br>
                    The "Skin" section, as the name suggests, gives the opportunity to change the player's skin.<br><br>
                    Applying all settings does not require restarting the game.

                    <br><br>After the game is openned, it randomly decides what skin will be used. It won't be changed after death.
                    <br>The skin of the ball will change randomly after every lose. (two of the ball's skin are my friend's face &#128520. Other skins
                    are the ones that I made in Photoshop using my imagination or redrawn by me items from Minecraft)

                    <br><br><span style="font-weight: 600;">After player collides with the ball: </span><br><br>
                    The game will show:<br>Time alive (seconds), score (how many times the ball reached left frame), and a few options: <br>
                    <ul class="content_ul">
                        <li>Play again</li>
                        <li>To the menu</li>
                        <li>Save score (requires to type player's name)</li>
                    </ul> 

                    <br><br><span style="font-size: 24px;">Leaderboard:</span><br><br>
                    Actually, it is not correct to name it "scoreboard", because it is "leaderboard". Only after i had done this part of the page
                    I noticed this mistake in the game. And it's kind of late to make any changes. I can, but don't want to.<br>
                    So, about the leaderboard. It reads the json file and simply prints all the data from the file. And sorts it by value i.e.
                    collected points (descending).

                    <br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px;">What have been used: </span><br><br>
                    I used my favourite language <span class=span_modules>Python.</span><br>All the logic in my game is made on this language.<br>
                    All the visual part of the game as well as the sounds are made on <span class=span_modules>pygame.</span><br>
                    Also to work with data I imported <span class=span_modules>json</span>, <span class=span_modules>os</span> 
                    and <span class=span_modules>sys.</span><br>
                    To provide random ball position to fly from, I used <span class=span_modules>randint</span> and <span class=span_modules>choice</span> from
                     module <span class=span_modules>random.</span><br>
                    To create an exe file have been used <span class=span_modules>pyinstaller.</span><br>
                    I used a lot of  loops, functions and also used try/catch constructions to work with files.<br><br>Also I created an anti AFK system:<br>
                    If a player decides to stay on one place to get a lot of points, after approximately 3 seconds the game will throw a ball right at him and he will lose.<br><br>

                    <br>My second (order not based on project creation date), more useful project, is a program that helps my mom with her work.<br>
                    The latest version of the project was created around June 28, 2021.<br>
                    Writing, if I'm not mistaken, took a couple of days, although the program is quite easy, 
                    since I had absolutely no idea how to work with Excel using code.
                    <br><br>With this project I really helped my mother a lot.<br>
                    Now, instead of losing a few days on reading nad comparing numbers, my program is doing it in a seconds.<br>

                    <br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px;">What has to be done: </span><br><br>
                    Mom has tons of data at work. Sales column and purchases column (contain the exact price of the item). 
                    She has to compare these two columns, and the ideal result is a complete match of both columns. 
                    But this never happens, because someone constantly makes mistakes in filling out, or data on any 
                    purchases and sales simply do not come due to various reasons.
                    <br><br>After comparing the tables (usually contains about 750 sales and 750 purchases), always 5 to 20
                    inequalities are revealed. Then she needs to figure out what these inequalities are, and why they appeared.
                    
                    <br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px;">What my program is doing: </span><br><br>
                    First of all, it is a console program and after opening an exe file, it will print to the console an example of
                    what the user should write in.<br>
                    User has to enter the name of the <span class=span_modules>.xmls</span> file that exists in the same directory
                    as the program exe file. If it doesn't exist, the program will stop working and will be closed.<br><br>
                    Also, in the excel file all the data should be written in the first 2 columns (A and B), if it is not, program
                    will not work correctly.

                    <br><br><span style="font-weight: 600;">If file exists and everything is fine: </span><br><br>
                    The program will: <br>
                    <ul class="content_ul">
                        <li>Print "Updated", in the next line elapsed time since the start of the program and will close itself</li>
                        <li>Then it will update an existing Excel file</li>
                        <li>In the D column it will print all the data that exist in the A column, but did not find a pair (the same number) in the B column</li>
                        <li>In the E column it will print all the data that exist in the B column, but did not find a pair in the A column</li>
                    </ul> 
                    
                    <br><br><br><span style="font-size: 24px;">What have been used: </span><br><br>
                    This time i also worked with <span class=span_modules>Python.</span><br>
                    To create an exe file have been used <span class=span_modules>pyinstaller.</span><br>
                    To open and rewrite an Excel file I used <span class=span_modules>openpyxl</span> module and imported
                    <span class=span_modules>os</span> to see computer's files.
                    Also, I wanted it to have at least some kind of beauty, I imported <span class=span_modules>time</span>, to
                    print elapsed time in the console as well as <span class=span_modules>Font, Color, Border, colors, Side</span> from
                    <span class=span_modules>openpyxl</span>.<br>
                    And of course the data comparing. It is done with the help <span class=span_modules>Counter</span> imported from
                    <span class=span_modules>Collections.</span>
                    <br><br>In these type of programs is better to use a C languages, because they are much faster.<br> But in that moment
                    i knew only Python and also it's not an actual product so there is no need to make it as fast as possible.
                    <br><br>You can try it yourself! <span style="color: black;"> &#x21B4;</span>
